* mentor

[[https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/mentor.html][https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/mentor.svg]]

mentor is a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][GNU Emacs]] frontend for the [[https://rakshasa.github.io/rtorrent/][rTorrent]] bittorrent client.

By default, it will start and run rTorrent from within Emacs but can also be
configured to use an external rTorrent instance over XML-RPC.

This project aims to provide a feature complete and highly customizable
interface, that will feel familiar to Emacs users.  Key bindings are chosen to
be as close to the vanilla rTorrent curses interface as possible.

mentor still has some way to go before it can really be considered a complete
interface, so please moderate your expectations.  It works fine for many common
tasks though, and in some cases (dare we say?) much better than the standard
ncurses interface.

integration.  Sort your downloads in a breeze!

** Features

Here is a summary of some of the features:

- Show torrents in a table, with configurable columns.
- Search torrents using ~C-s~ (no more of the manual up/down).
- Mark and perform operations on more than one torrent at once.
- Sort torrents according to one or more criteria.
- Move downloads together with their data in one command.
- Switch between views, create new etc. (like numbers)
- Support for most standard operations.  (Start/stop/rehash/move etc.)
- Use all Emacs features you are used to: macros, Emacs Lisp, etc.

** Installing mentor

*** Installing through NonGNU ELPA (recommended)

You can install mentor from [[https://elpa.nongnu.org/][NonGNU ELPA]].  Find and install Mentor using this
command:

: M-x package-list-packages

NonGNU ELPA is configured by default in Emacs 28.1 or later.  For earlier
versions of Emacs, please see the specific instructions for how to configure
[[https://elpa.nongnu.org/][NonGNU ELPA]].

Mentor should work on Emacs 25 or later.  For the best performance I recommend
using at least Emacs 27.1, built with ~libxml~ support.  (See "Known issues"
below.)  I almost never test Mentor using old versions of Emacs, so please
report any issues you run into.

*** Installing mentor manually

You can also install mentor manually.  First, make sure you have the minimum
version of [[https://github.com/xml-rpc-el/xml-rpc-el][xml-rpc.el]] installed.

Clone this repository using:

: git clone https://github.com/skangas/mentor.git

Add this to your init.el:

: (add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/mentor/")
: (require 'mentor)

Change "~/src/mentor" to the path where you keep the mentor source code.

To byte-compile mentor, go to the source directory and run:

: make

To setup autoloading, you can add this to your Init file:

: (autoload 'mentor "mentor" nil t)

** Quick Start

Make sure that you have rTorrent (0.9.0 or later) installed on your system.

To start mentor, just run:

: M-x mentor

It should work out of the box, but you may want to do some additional
configuration.

** Configuration

*** General

You can find additional Mentor options in customize.

 : M-x customize-group RET mentor RET

Two useful variables to customize are ~mentor-rtorrent-download-directory~ and
~mentor-rtorrent-keep-session~.

*** External rTorrent

If you are already running rTorrent outside of Emacs, it is easy to configure
Mentor to use it.

Add this to your ~~/.rtorrent.rc~ and restart rTorrent:

: scgi_local = ~/.rtorrent-rpc.socket
: encoding.add = utf8

Customize ~mentor-rtorrent-external-rpc~, or add this to your Init file and
restart Emacs.

: (setq mentor-rtorrent-external-rpc "~/.rtorrent-rpc.socket")

You can also specify an absolute path:

: ;; Alternative 2: Absolute path
: (setq mentor-rtorrent-external-rpc "/path/to/rtorrent-rpc.socket")

It is also possible to connect to rtorrent over http.  There are instructions on
configuring this on the [[https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent/wiki/RPC-Setup-XMLRPC][rtorrent wiki]].

: ;; Alternative 3: Use a web server
: (setq mentor-rtorrent-external-rpc "https://127.0.0.1:8080/RPC2")

Finally, you can connect directly to rtorrent over scgi.  However, anyone that
can send rtorrent xmlrpc requests can in all likelihood also execute arbitrary
code as the user running rtorrent.  Therefore, this is inadvisable on anything
but the loopback device (e.g. ~127.0.0.1~) on single-user systems.

It is almost always easier and better to use a Unix domain socket (file) as
suggested above.

: ;; Alternative 4: Connect directly to rtorrent over scgi
: (setq mentor-rtorrent-external-rpc "scgi://127.0.0.1:5000")

** Known issues
- There is no view for trackers/peers/extra information.

- Mentor can be slow if Emacs was not built with ~libxml~ support.  This
  typically happens only when there are several hundreds, or even thousands, of
  torrents loaded in rtorrent.  Use an Emacs built with ~libxml~ support to
  avoid this issue.  (Support for ~libxml~ was added in Emacs 27.1.)
